**What is this 3D dataset about?:** This is a dataset of high-resolution lightsheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) images and the corresponding segmentations of vasculations in (1) four different sub-regions of mouse brain, and (2) seven other organs (live, tongue, heart, bladder, ear, muscle, spinal cord). See [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667237523000516).
